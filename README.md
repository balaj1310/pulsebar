`PulseBar` is an unofficial macOS menu bar monitor for telemetry exposed by the DGX Dashboard web app on NVIDIA DGX Spark and compatible NVIDIA GB10-based OEM systems. It signs in to the local dashboard, listens to the server-sent event stream, and shows a compact `RAM` and `GPU` status item in the menu bar.

## Requirements

- macOS 13 Ventura or newer.
- Local DGX Dashboard reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:11000` through either NVIDIA Sync or a manual SSH tunnel.
- Valid dashboard credentials.

## Compatible Systems

PulseBar targets the local DGX Dashboard rather than a specific enclosure. Known compatible NVIDIA GB10 variants are:

- [NVIDIA DGX Spark](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/)
- [Acer Veriton GN100 AI Mini Workstation](https://www.acer.com/us-en/desktops-and-all-in-ones/veriton-workstations/veriton-gn100-ai-mini-workstation)
- [ASUS Ascent GX10](https://www.asus.com/de/networking-iot-servers/desktop-ai-supercomputer/ultra-small-ai-supercomputers/asus-ascent-gx10/)
- [Dell Pro Max with GB10](https://www.dell.com/de-de/dt/lp/dell-pro-max-nvidia-ai-dev)
- [GIGABYTE AI TOP ATOM](https://www.gigabyte.com/de/AI-TOP-PC/GIGABYTE-AI-TOP-ATOM)
- [HP ZGX Nano AI Station](https://www.hp.com/de-de/workstations/zgx-nano-ai-station.html)
- [Lenovo ThinkStation PGX](https://www.lenovo.com/de/de/p/workstations/thinkstationp/lenovo-thinkstation-pgx-sff/len102s0023)
- [MSI EdgeXpert MS-C931](https://ipc.msi.com/product_detail/Industrial-Computer-Box-PC/AI-Supercomputer/EdgeXpert-MS-C931)

[NVIDIA Sync](https://build.nvidia.com/spark/connect-to-your-spark/sync) can expose the local dashboard automatically. Without NVIDIA Sync, forward the dashboard port manually, following NVIDIA's [manual SSH flow](https://build.nvidia.com/spark/connect-to-your-spark/manual-ssh):

```bash
ssh -L 11000:localhost:11000 <username>@<IP-or-spark-hostname.local>
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:11000` and sign in with the same dashboard credentials PulseBar uses.

## Installation

Download the latest GitHub Release DMG, open it, and drag `PulseBar.app` to Applications.

Signed direct-download builds can check for app updates from the PulseBar menu.

## First Run

1. Launch PulseBar.
2. Open `Preferences…` from the menu bar item.
3. Enter your dashboard username and password.
4. After sign-in, PulseBar stores the returned token in Keychain and starts the telemetry stream.
5. On later launches, PulseBar restores the saved session and reconnects automatically.
